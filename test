Our previous multicenter studies under the SEQC-2 umbrella using a breast cancer cell line with paired B-cell line have produced a large amount of different genomic data including whole genome sequencing (Illumina, PacBio, Nanopore), HiC, and scRNA-seq with detailed analyses on somatic mutations, single-nucleotide variations (SNVs), and structural variations (SVs). However, there is still a lack of well-characterized reference materials which include epigenomic and proteomic data. Here we further performed ATAC-seq, Methyl-seq, RNA-seq, and proteomic analyses and provided a comprehensive catalog of the epigenomic landscape, which overlapped with the transcriptomes and proteomes for the two cell lines. We identified >7,700 peptide isoforms, where the majority (95%) of the genes had a single peptide isoform. Protein expression of the transcripts overlapping CGIs were much higher than the protein expression of the non-CGI transcripts in both cell lines. We further demonstrated the evidence that certain SNVs were incorporated into mutated peptides. We observed that open chromatin regions had low methylation which were largely regulated by CG density, where CG-rich regions had more accessible chromatin, low methylation, and higher gene and protein expression. The CG-poor regions had higher repressive epigenetic regulations (higher DNA methylation) and less open chromatin, resulting in a cell line specific methylation and gene expression patterns. Our studies provide well-defined reference materials consisting of two cell lines with genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, scRNA-seq and proteomic characterizations which can serve as standards for validating and benchmarking not only on various omics assays, but also on bioinformatics methods. It will be a valuable resource for both research and clinical communities.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.09.612081","title":"A Comparison of Tokenization Impact in AttentionBased and State Space Genomic Language Models","authors":"Lindsey, L.

Existing genomic language models have utilized various tokenization methods including character tokenization, overlapping and non-overlapping k-mer tokenization, and byte-pair encoding, a method widely used in natural language models. Genomic models have significant differences from natural language and protein language models because of their low character variability, complex and overlapping features, and inconsistent directionality. These differences make sub-word tokenization in genomic language models significantly different from traditional language models. This study explores the impact of tokenization in attention-based and state-space genomic language models by evaluating their downstream performance on various fine-tuning tasks. We propose new definitions for fertility, the token per word ratio, in the context of genomic language models, and introduce tokenization parity, which measures how consistently a tokenizer parses homologous sequences. We also perform an ablation study on the state-space model, Mamba, to evaluate the impact of character-based tokenization compared to byte-pair encoding. Our results indicate that the choice of tokenizer significantly impacts model performance and that when experiments control for input sequence length, character tokenization is the best choice in state-space models for all evaluated task categories except epigenetic mark prediction.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.11.612418","title":"SVbyEye: A visual tool to characterize structural variation among whole-genome assemblies","authors":"Porubsky, D.; Guitart, X.; Yoo, D.; Dishuck, P.

The organic substrate dynamics within pelagic microbial communities are strongly controlled by microorganismal interactions, resulting in a dense interactome. While the role of bacteria in the microbial loop is well documented, the degradation capacity and substrate specificity of marine fungi, as well as their role and function in metabolic guilds with bacteria, is comparatively less understood. We chose the polysaccharide laminarin, a major product of marine primary production, as well as oligomeric laminarin subunits and monomeric glucose, to study the degradation capacity of eleven marine yeast isolates from the pelagic microbial community of Helgoland Roads. Our aim was to measure yeast growth and correlate degradation yields and putative intermediate degradation products with the size of laminarin-based organic precursor substrates. We developed a reproducible, temporally resolved, high-throughput growth protocol to measure resource-specific yeast growth. Measurement of temporally fine-scaled growth kinetic models of isolates were accompanied with qualitative and quantitative chemical analyses of substrates and degradation intermediates. Our data showed that yeast growth was negatively correlated with oligomer length. Fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate electrophoresis suggested the lack of enzymatic endo-activity for laminarin in yeasts under investigation, suggesting they may occupy a niche in the microbial loop, benefitting from extracellular hydrolysis of carbohydrates by other microorganisms. In terrestrial environments, namely forest soil ecosystems, yeasts have been assigned a similar niche, supporting a prominent role of yeasts in microbial interactomes.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=111 SRC=\"FIGDIR\/small\/612705v1_fig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (22K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@112655org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ebb74forg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4fb6fcorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17665d5_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigure 1:C_FLOATNO Graphical abstract:\n\nNiche position of marine yeasts in the microbial loop: This graphical abstract depicts the proposed role of marine yeasts within the marine microbial loop, highlighting their interactions with bacteria and phytoplankton.

The molecular mechanism(s) responsible for this fate bias remain unclear. Here we report that linker histone regulates HSPC fate choice at the lymphoid versus myeloid bifurcation. HSPCs expressing H1.0 from a doxycycline (dox) inducible transgene favor the lymphoid fate, display strengthened nucleosome organization and reduced chromatin accessibility at genomic regions hosting key myeloid fate drivers. The transcription factor Hlf is located in one of such regions, where chromatin accessibility and gene expression is reduced in H1.0high HSPCs. Furthermore, H1.0 protein in HSPCs can decreases in an aspartyl protease dependent manner, a process enhanced in response to interferon alpha signaling. Aspartyl protease inhibitors preserve endogenous H1.0 levels and promote the lymphoid fate of wild type HSPCs. Thus, our work uncovers a point of intervention to mitigate myeloid skewed hematopoiesis.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612586","title":"Towards explaining the fertility gap in farmed Pekin ducks","authors":"Beyts, C.

However, while social interactions and mating strategies are known to influence reproductive success in wild populations, their consideration in agricultural systems remains limited. Using an interdisciplinary framework that combines concepts from behavioural ecology and quantitative genetics in an animal breeding context, we investigated the role of sperm limitation and polygynous mating strategies (female polyandry, male monopolisation of females and male polygamy) in limiting female reproductive success in farmed Pekin ducks (Anas platyrthynchos domestica). We assessed the impact of these behaviours on chick production and quantified their genetic and environmental (co)variance. Our results revealed that the number of dam mates positively influenced chick production in female ducks. However, contrary to our expectation, skew in chick paternity (our measure of male monopolisation) was associated with increased female chick production, challenging the hypothesis that male monopolisation limits the sperm available to females and reduces their reproductive success. We found no evidence that male polygamy led to decreased female chick production. Genetic analysis revealed that female mate number and reproductive skew exhibit genetic variance, providing opportunities for targeted selection to enhance chick production. However, there was a negative genetic association between female polyandry and skew in chick paternity, suggesting a trade-off between these traits that would need to be considered in future selection programmes. Our findings highlight how concepts from behavioural ecology can be incorporated into breeding programmes, providing new opportunities to develop effective and sustainable breeding strategies.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.14.613032","title":"The global spectrum of tree crown architecture","authors":"Jucker, T.; Fischer, F.; Chave, J.; Coomes, D.; Caspersen, J.; Ali, A.; Panzou, G.; Feldpausch, T.; Falster, D.; Usoltsev, V.; Jackson, T.; Adu-Bredu, S.; Alves, L.; Aminpour, M.; Angoboy, I.; Anten, N.; Antin, C.; Askari, Y.; Munoz, R.; Ayyappan, N.; Banin, L.; Barbier, N.; Battles, J.; Beeckman, H.; Bocko, Y.; Bond-Lamberty, B.; Bongers, F.; Bowers, S.; Breugel, M.; Chantrain, A.; Chaudhary, R.; Dai, J.; Dalponte, M.; Dimobe, K.; Domec, J.-C.; Doucet, J.-L.; Dupuy-Rada, J.; Duursma, R.; Enriquez, M.; Ewijk, K.; Farfan-Rios, W.; Fayolle, A.; Ferretti, M.; Forni, E.; Forrester, D.; Gilani, H.;","author_corresponding":"Tommaso Jucker","author_corresponding_institution":"University of Bristol","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"ecology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.14.613032.source.xml","abstract":"Trees can differ enormously in their crown architectural traits, such as the scaling relationships that link their height and crown size to their stem diameter. Yet despite the importance of crown architecture in shaping the structure and function of woody ecosystems, we lack a complete picture of what drives this incredible diversity in crown shapes. Using data from >500,000 globally distributed trees, we explored how climate, disturbance, competition, functional traits, and evolutionary history constrain the height, crown size and shape of the world's tree species. We found that variation in height scaling relationships was primarily controlled by water availability and light competition. Conversely, crown width was predominantly shaped by exposure to wind and fire, while also covarying with other functional traits related to mechanical stability and photosynthesis. Additionally, several plant lineages had crown architectures that defy their environments, such as the exceedingly slender dipterocarps of Southeast Asia, or the extremely wide crowns of legumes in African savannas. Our study charts the global spectrum of tree crown architectural types. It provides a roadmap for integrating crown architecture with vegetation models and remote sensing observations, so that we may better understand the processes that shape the 3D structure of woody ecosystems.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.14.613048","title":"Pan-Cancer Genetic Analysis of Mitochondrial DNA Repair Gene Set","authors":"Dong, A.; Rasteh, A.

This study investigates the clinical relevance of mitochondrial DNA repair genes: PARP1, DNA 2, PRIMPOL, TP53, MGME1. Methods: Using multi-omics profiling data and Gene Set Cancer Analysis (GSCA) with normalized SEM mRNA expression, this research analyzes differential expression, gene mutation, and drug correlation. Results: TP53 was the most commonly mutated mitochondrial-related gene in cancer, with UCS and OV having the highest mutation rates. CPG mutations linked to lowest survival rates. Breast cancer, with various subtypes, was potentially influenced by mitochondrial DNA repair genes. ACC was shown to be high in gene survival analysis. BRCA, USC, LUCS, COAD, and OV showed CNV levels impacting survival. A negative gene expression-methylation correlation was observed and was weakest in KIRC. Mitochondrial DNA repair genes were linked to Cell cycle_A activation. A weak correlation was found between immune infiltration and mitochondrial genes. Few drug compounds were shown to be affected by mitochondrial-related genes. Conclusion: Understanding mitochondrial-related genes could redefine cancer diagnosis, and prognosis, and serve as therapeutic biomarkers, potentially altering cancer cell behavior and treatment outcomes.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.613281","title":"The Pattern and Staging of Brain Atrophy in Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2): MRI Volumetrics from ENIGMA-Ataxia","authors":"Robertson, J.

Atrophy of the cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord are core features of SCA2, however the evolution and pattern of whole-brain atrophy in SCA2 remain unclear. We undertook a multi-site, structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study to comprehensively characterize the neurodegeneration profile of SCA2. Methods: Voxel-based morphometry analyses of 110 participants with SCA2 and 128 controls were undertaken to assess groupwise differences in whole-brain volume. Correlations with clinical severity and genotype, and cross-sectional profiling of atrophy patterns at different disease stages, were also performed. Results: Atrophy in SCA2 relative to controls was greatest (Cohen's d>2.5) in the cerebellar white matter (WM), middle cerebellar peduncle, pons, and corticospinal tract. Very large effects (d>1.5) were also evident in the superior cerebellar, inferior cerebellar, and cerebral peduncles. In cerebellar grey matter (GM), large effects (d>0.8) mapped to areas related to both motor coordination and cognitive tasks. Strong correlations (|r|>0.4) between volume and disease severity largely mirrored these groupwise outcomes. Stratification by disease severity showed a degeneration pattern beginning in cerebellar and pontine WM in pre-clinical subjects; spreading to the cerebellar GM and cerebro-cerebellar\/corticospinal WM tracts; then finally involving the thalamus, striatum, and cortex in severe stages. Interpretation: The magnitude and pattern of brain atrophy evolves over the course of SCA2, with widespread, non-uniform involvement across the brainstem, cerebellar tracts, and cerebellar cortex; and late involvement of the cerebral cortex and striatum.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.613268","title":"A single ancestral ANP32 locus in ticks creates multiple protein variants that all support the Thogoto virus polymerase","authors":"Zhang, Z.; Nipper, T.; Aziati, I.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza virus, an orthomyxovirus, requires cellular ANP32A or ANP32B proteins for genome replication. However, little is known about whether ANP32 proteins are required by other orthomyxoviruses like the tick-borne thogotoviruses. Recent structural studies coupled with functional assays suggested that the Thogoto virus polymerase uses both ANP32A and ANP32B from brown dog ticks. We clarify here that this tick vector encodes a single ANP32 locus corresponding to ANP32A. This single gene produces multiple protein variants through alternative splicing and start-site selection, all of which enhance Thogoto virus polymerase. Thogoto virus polymerase activity is also enhanced by human and chicken ANP32 proteins. Thus, ANP32A is a deeply conserved pro-viral cofactor and Thogoto virus shows remarkable plasticity utilizing ANP32 homologues separated by almost 1 billion years of evolution.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.613361","title":"High-throughput optimized prime editing mediated endogenous protein tagging for pooled imaging of protein localization","authors":"Sanchez, H.

We constructed a pooled library of 17,280 pegRNAs designed to exhaustively tag 60 endogenous proteins spanning diverse localization patterns and explore a large space of genomic and pegRNA design parameters. Pooled measurements of tagging efficiency uncovered both genomic and pegRNA features associated with increased efficiency, including epigenetic states and interactions with transcription. We integrate pegRNA features into a computational model with predictive value for tagging efficiency to constrain the design space of pegRNAs for large-scale peptide knock-in. Lastly, we show that combining in-situ pegRNA sequencing with high-throughput deep learning image analysis, enables exploration of subcellular protein localization patterns for many proteins in parallel following a single pooled lentiviral transduction, setting the stage for scalable studies of proteome dynamics across cell types and environmental perturbations.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.613379","title":"Quantitative Comparison of Monomeric StayGold Variants Using Protein Nanocages in Living Cells","authors":"Viola, G.; Jacobs, K.

Recent studies have demonstrated the generation of brain pericytes using a neural crest-based differentiation protocol. However, the inflammatory response of these iPSC-derived brain pericytes has not been investigated. We aimed to investigate the response of iPSC-derived brain pericytes to common inflammatory stimuli, thereby assessing the suitability of these cells to study inflammatory disease. Methods: Brain pericytes were differentiated from iPSCs for 42 days. The expression of brain pericyte markers was assessed by RT-qPCR and immunofluorescent staining at days 0, 15, 21, and 42 of differentiation to validate the brain pericyte-like phenotype. Nuclear localisation of NF{kappa}B and STAT1 was assessed by immunofluorescence following IL-1{beta}- and TNF-treatment in day 21 and day 42 iPSC-derived pericytes, and primary human pericytes. Cytometric bead array assessed the concentration of secreted inflammatory factors in the cell medium and phagocytosis was investigated using fluorescent carboxylated beads and flow cytometry. Results: At day 42 of differentiation, but not at day 21, cells expressed brain pericyte markers. Generally, iPSC-derived pericytes lacked consistent responses to inflammatory treatment compared to primary human pericytes. Day 21 and 42 iPSC-derived pericytes exhibited a NF{kappa}B response to IL-1{beta} treatment comparable to primary human pericytes. Day 21 iPSC-derived pericytes exhibited a STAT1 response with IL-1{beta} treatment which was absent in day 42 cells, but present in a subset of primary human pericytes. TNF treatment presented similar NF{kappa}B responses between day 21 and 42 iPSC-derived and primary human pericytes, but a STAT1 response was again present in a subset of primary human pericytes which was absent in both day 21 and day 42 iPSC-derived pericytes. Numerous differences were observed in the secretion of cytokines and chemokines following treatment of iPSC-derived and primary human pericytes with IL-1{beta} and TNF. iPSC-derived pericytes exhibited greater rates of phagocytosis than primary human pericytes. Conclusions: With the increase in iPSC-derived cells in research, labs should undertake validation of lineage specificity when adapting an iPSC-derived differentiation protocol. In our hands, the inflammatory response of iPSC-derived pericytes was different to that of primary human pericytes, raising concern regarding the use of iPSC-derived pericytes to study neuroinflammatory disease.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613382","title":"Autophagy acts as a brake on obesity-related fibrosis by controlling purine nucleoside signalling","authors":"Piletic, K.; Kayvanjoo, A.

Autophagy promotes adipocyte differentiation and lipid homeostasis, but its role in obese adipocytes and adipose tissue dysfunction remains incompletely understood. Here, we demonstrate that autophagy is a key tissue-specific regulator of WAT remodelling in diet-induced obesity. Importantly, loss of adipocyte autophagy substantially exacerbates pericellular fibrosis in visceral WAT. Change in WAT architecture correlates with increased infiltration of macrophages with tissue-reparative, fibrotic features. We uncover that autophagy regulates purine nucleoside metabolism in obese adipocytes, preventing excessive release of the purine catabolites xanthine and hypoxanthine. Purines signal cell-extrinsically for fibrosis by driving macrophage polarisation towards a tissue reparative phenotype. Our findings reveal a novel role for adipocyte autophagy in regulating tissue purine nucleoside metabolism, thereby limiting obesity-associated fibrosis and maintaining the functional integrity of visceral WAT. Purine signals may serve as a critical balance checkpoint and therapeutic target in fibrotic diseases.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.613371","title":"HP1\u03b1-driven Phase Separation and Repair Pathway Choice in Response to Heterochromatin Damage","authors":"Bohra, D.; Mazumder, A.","author_corresponding":"Aprotim Mazumder","author_corresponding_institution":"TIFR Centre for Interdisciplinary Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research Hyderabad","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"cell biology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.16.613371.source.xml","abstract":"Double-strand breaks (DSBs) pose significant threat to genomic stability and need immediate attention from DNA Damage Response (DDR) machinery involved in Homologous Recombination (HR) or Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ).

We show that the minute-scale dynamics of HP1 and HP1{beta} differ dramatically and they promote differential recruitment of HR vs. NHEJ factors at the sites of laser-induced clustered DSBs. Perturbing HP1 phase-separation abrogates both the recruitment of HR factors and readouts of HR. Our study provides a link between phase-separation and DDR-centric roles of HP1 and hints at spatial partitioning of repair pathways in response to damage in heterochromatin.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.613146","title":"Revisiting the taxonomy of Enterococcus casseliflavus and related species","authors":"Soares de Medeiros Lima, M.

The classification of E. casseliflavus is challenging, as it presents 99% identity in 16S analysis with E. gallinarum and, mainly, with E. flavescens, often being classified as a single species. This study aimed to revisit the taxonomy of E. casseliflavus and other related species by carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the genomic data available for these species in public databases.analyzing the genomic data. For this, 155 genomes of E. casseliflavus related species (E. casseliflavus, E. flavescens, E. entomosocium, and E. innesii) were retrieved and submitted to Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) and phylogenomic analysis. Both approaches showed three well-delineated clusters which correspond to three Enterococcus species (E. casseliflavus, E. flavescens and E. innesii).

By analyzing simple population models, we show that, very generally, population fluctuations favor the evolution of dormancy, but dormancy stabilizes population dynamics. This sets up a feedback loop that can enable the coexistence of alternative dormancy strategies. Over longer timescales, we show that evolution of dormancy to an evolutionary stable state can drive populations to the edge of stability, where dynamics are only weakly stabilized. We briefly consider how these conclusions are likely to apply in more complex community contexts. Our results suggest that chaos and high-amplitude population cycles are highly vulnerable to invasion and subsequent stabilization by dormancy, potentially explaining their rarity. At the same time, the propensity of ecological dynamics to fluctuate may be an underappreciated driver of the evolution of dormancy.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612653","title":"Proteogenomic Characterization of Primary Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas Unveils the Extracellular Matrix Remodeling and Immunosuppressive Microenvironment Linked with Lymph Node Metastasis","authors":"Liu, Y.; Yang, Z.; Pu, J.

TWAS facilitates gene expression mapping studies based on a reference panel of transcriptomic data to build a prediction model to identify expression quantitative loci (eQTLs) affecting gene expressions. These eQTLs leverage the construction of genetically regulated gene expression (GReX) in the GWAS data and a test between imputed GReX and the trait indicates gene-trait association. Such a two-step approach ignores the uncertainty of the predicted expression and can lead to reduced inference accuracy, e.g., inflated type-I error in TWAS. To circumvent a two-step approach, we develop a unified Bayesian method for TWAS, combining the two datasets simultaneously. We consider the horseshoe prior in the transcriptome data while modeling the relationship between the gene expression and local SNPs and the spike and slab prior while testing for an association between the GReX and the trait. We extend our approach to conducting a multi-ancestry TWAS, focusing on discovering genes that affect the trait in all ancestries.

In line with the societal goal to replace or reduce vertebrate animal testing, alternative bioassays were developed to replace testing with fish: the fish cell line RTgill-W1 acute toxicity assay (OECD TG249) and the zebrafish embryo acute toxicity test (zFET, OECD TG236). However, previous studies revealed the lower sensitivity of the RTgill-W1 cell line assay and zFET for some neurotoxic chemicals and allyl alcohol, which is presumably biotransformed in fish to the more toxic acrolein (which is predicted well through the cell line assay). To provide an additional alternative to acute fish toxicity, in this study, we analyzed historic ecotoxicity data for fish and daphnids from the EnviroTox Database. We found a considerable variability in acute fish LC50 and acute daphnids EC50 values, particularly for neurotoxic chemicals. Comparing sensitivity of these taxonomic groups according to different neurotoxicity classification schemes indicates that fish rarely represent the most sensitive trophic level of the two. Exceptions here most prominently include a few cyclodiene compounds, which are no longer marketed, and a chemical group that could be identified through structural alerts. Moreover, daphnids are more sensitive than fish to acrolein. This analysis highlights the potential of the Daphnia acute toxicity test, which is usually a standard regulatory data requirement, in safeguarding the environmental protection level provided by the RTgill-W1 cell line assay and the zFET. This research, rooted in decades of efforts to replace the fish acute toxicity test, shifts the focus from predicting fish toxicity 1-to-1 to emphasizing the protectiveness of alternative methods, paving the way for further eliminating vertebrate tests in environmental toxicology.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.08.611882","title":"Phenotypic diversity and shared genomic determinants among isolates causing a large incidence of disseminated gonococcal infections in Canada","authors":"Binepal, G.; Jurga, E.; Carruthers-Lay, D.; Kru\u0308ger, S.; Zittermann, S.; Minion, J.; Diggle, M.; Alexander, D.

Phenotypic analysis of a matched subset of 19 isolates obtained since 2013 found that these varied in their capacity to aggregate in suspension and in their association with serum complement proteins, however these interactions did not discriminate between the invasive and mucosal isolates. Sequence typing of 360 Canadian isolates revealed that two porB alleles are significantly associated with the DGI strains, one of these being present throughout the past decade whereas the other became associated more recently. A PopNet-based population dynamics analysis, which instead establishes relationships based upon variance among discrete chromosomal segments, found that DGI isolates were restricted in their phylogenetic distribution. While this implies a genetically-linked potential to cause invasive disease, it cannot distinguish between an inherent difference in the phenotype of these populations or the horizontal exchange of some virulence factor among closely related strains. Regardless, a large number of genetic determinants are enriched in the DGI strains, making these enticing candidates for future work to understand how they might either promote the gonococcal capacity to cause systemic infection or reduce the presentation of clinical symptoms from localized infection so that it remains untreated.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612708","title":"Loss of PRICKLE1 in the myometrium leads to reduced fertility, abnormal myometrial architecture, and aberrant extracellular matrix deposition in mice.","authors":"Roberts, E.; Ganeshkumar, S.; Gunewardena, S.; Chennathukuzhi, V.

Symptoms of UL include pelvic pain, pressure, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia, anemia, and reproductive dysfunction. Currently, there is no effective long-term pharmacotherapy for UL, making them the leading cause of hysterectomies in the United States. The lack of treatment options is attributed to the absence of accurate animal models and a limited understanding of UL pathogenesis. Previous research has shown the loss of repressor of element 1 silencing transcription factor\/neuron-restrictive silencing factor (REST\/NRSF) within the myometrium promotes UL pathogenesis. In addition, deletion of Rest in the mouse myometrium leads to a UL phenotype. PRICKLE1, also known as Rest-interacting LIM-domain Protein (RILP), is required for nuclear localization of REST and Wnt\/planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling, making it a critical target for UL studies. In the context of PCP, smooth muscle cells in UL show abnormal organization, aberrant ECM structure, and expression levels, potentially influenced by PRICKLE1 loss. The exact role of PRICKLE1 and Wnt\/PCP in UL pathogenesis remains unclear. To explore PRICKLE1's role in UL, we deleted Prickle1 using our myometrial-specific icre. Our findings demonstrate that Prickle1 loss in the myometrium results in a UL phenotype characterized by altered collagen expression, excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, aberrant smooth muscle cell organization, increased Esr1 and Pgr expression, and dysregulated Wnt\/PCP signaling.

Specifically, loss of p53 dramatically alters chromatin structure at the nuclear periphery, allowing increased transmission of an environmental carcinogen, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, into the nucleus. Genome-wide mapping of UV-induced DNA lesions in p53-deficient primary cells reveals increased lesion abundance corresponding to regions of high mutation burden in malignant melanomas. These findings uncover a novel role of p53 in the suppression of mutations that contribute to cancer and highlight the critical influence of nuclear architecture in regulating sensitivity to carcinogens.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612750","title":"Targeting cancer-associated glycosylation for adoptive T cell therapy of gastro-intestinal and gynecological cancers","authors":"Zingg, A.; Ritschard, R.; Thut, H.; Buchi, M.; Holbro, A.; Oseledchyk, A.; Heinzelmann, V.; Buser, A.; Binder, M.; Zippelius, A.; Mantuano, N.

Here, we describe the generation of a fully human CAR targeting altered glycosylation in secretory epithelial cancers. The expression of the target antigen, the truncated, sialylated O-glycan sialyl-Thomsen-Nouveau antigen (STn), was studied with a highly STn-specific antibody across various different tumor tissues. Strong expression was found in a high proportion of gastro-intestinal cancers including pancreatic cancers and in gynecological cancers, in particular ovarian and endometrial tumors. T cells expressing anti-STn CAR were tested in vitro and in vivo. Anti-STn CAR T cells showed activity in mouse models as well as in assays with primary ovarian cancer samples. No significant toxicity was observed in mouse models, although some intraluminal expression of STn was found in gastro-intestinal mouse tissue. Taken together, this fully human anti-STn CAR construct shows promising activity in preclinical tumor models supporting its further evaluation in early clinical trials.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612728","title":"Inhibition of glutaminase elicits senolysis in therapy-induced senescent melanoma cells.","authors":"Kim, J.; Brunetti, B.; Kumar, A.; Mangla, A.; Honda, K.; Yoshida, A.","author_corresponding":"Akihiro Yoshida","author_corresponding_institution":"Case Western Reserve University","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"cancer biology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.12.612728.source.xml","abstract":"The cyclin D1-Cyclin-Dependent Kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4\/6) complex is crucial for the development of melanoma. We previously demonstrated that targeting CDK4\/6 using small molecule inhibitors (CDK4\/6i) suppresses BrafV600E melanoma growth in vitro and in vivo through induction of cellular senescence. Clinical trials investigating CDK4\/6i in melanoma have not yielded successful outcomes, underscoring the necessity to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of CDK4\/6i. Accumulated research has shown that while senescence initially suppresses cell proliferation, a prolonged state of senescence eventually leads to tumor relapse by altering the tumor microenvironment, suggesting that removal of those senescent cells (in a process referred to as senolysis) is of clinical necessity to facilitate clinical response. We demonstrate that glutaminase 1 (GLS1) expression is specifically upregulated in CDK4\/6i-induced senescent BrafV600E melanoma cells. Upregulated GLS1 expression renders BrafV600E melanoma senescent cells vulnerable to GLS1 inhibitor (GLS1i). Furthermore, we demonstrate that this senolytic approach targeting upregulated GLS1 expression is applicable even though those cells developed resistance to the BrafV600E inhibitor vemurafenib, a frequently encountered substantial clinical challenge to treating patients. Thus, this novel senolytic approach may revolutionize current CDK4\/6i mediated melanoma treatment if melanoma cells undergo senescence prior to developing resistance to CDK4\/6i. Given that we demonstrate that a low dose of vemurafenib induced senescence, which renders BrafV600E melanoma cells susceptible to GLS1i and recent accumulated research shows many cancer cells undergo senescence in response to chemotherapy, radiation, and immunotherapy, this senolytic therapy approach may prove applicable to a wide range of cancer types once senescence and GLS1 expression are induced.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612712","title":"Developmental transcriptomics in Pristionchus reveals the logic of a plasticity gene regulatory network","authors":"Reich, S.; Loschko, T.; Jung, J.; Nestel, S.; Sommer, R.

While significant advances in understanding the ecological and evolutionary implications of plasticity have been made, understanding its genetic basis has lagged. However, a decade of genetic screens in the model nematode Pristionchus pacificus has culminated in 30 genes which affect mouth-form plasticity. We also recently reported the critical window of environmental sensitivity, and therefore have clear expectations for when differential gene expression should matter. Here, we collated previous data into a gene-regulatory network (GRN), and performed developmental transcriptomics across different environmental conditions, genetic backgrounds, and mouth-form mutants to assess the regulatory logic of plasticity. We found that only two genes in the GRN (eud-1 and seud-1\/sult-1) are sensitive to the environment during the critical window. Interestingly, the time points of their sensitivity differ, suggesting that they act as sequential checkpoints. We also observed temporal constraint upon the transcriptional effects of mutating the GRN and revealed unexpected feedback between mouth-form genes. Surprisingly, expression of seud-1\/sult-1, but not eud-1, correlated with mouth form biases across different strains and species. Finally, a comprehensive analysis of all samples identified metabolism as a shared pathway for regulating mouth-form plasticity. These data are presented in a Shiny app to facilitate gene-expression comparisons across development in up to 14 different conditions. Collectively, our results suggest that mouth-form plasticity evolved a constrained, two-tiered logic to integrate environmental information leading up to the final developmental decision.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613386","title":"Functional consequences of fast-spiking interneurons in striatum","authors":"Guo, L.; Kumar, A.","author_corresponding":"Lihao Guo","author_corresponding_institution":"KTH","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.17.613386.source.xml","abstract":"The striatum features a distinct network characterized by a high degree of shared feedforward inhibition (FFI) from a mere 1% of fast-spiking interneurons (FSI).

Our findings reveal that FSIs increase the across-trial variability of striatal responses to cortical stimuli and, combined with recurrent inhibition, lead to a 'correlation attractor' of striatal activities, i.e., weakly correlated inputs result in more correlated responses and vice versa. Thus, we uncover a mechanism by which input correlation can be bidirectionally modulated, which is possible only because of high sharing of FSI inputs. We posit that the emergence of a correlation attractor leads to non-zero correlation level and variable rate trajectories of striatal responses across trials, hence beneficial for exploration in learning.

As a result, current V1 models fail to explain neural responses in a number of scenarios.

However, both blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI and vascular space occupancy data (VASO) have certain limitations, such as bias towards larger cortical veins in BOLD fMRI and high specific absorption rate in VASO. This study aims to explore the feasibility of whole-brain laminar functional quantitative susceptibility mapping (fQSM) compared to laminar BOLD fMRI and VASO at ultra-high field. Data were acquired using 3D EPI techniques. Complex data were denoised with NORDIC and susceptibility maps were computed using 3D path-based unwrapping, the variable-kernel sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction as well as the streaking artifact reduction for QSM algorithms. To assess layer-specific activation, twenty layers were segmented in the somatosensory and motor cortices, obtained from a finger tapping paradigm, and further averaged into six anatomical cortical layers. The magnitude of signal change and z-scores were compared across layers for each technique. fQSM showed the largest activation-dependent mean susceptibility decrease in Layers II\/III in M1 and Layers I\/ II in S1 with up to -1.3 ppb while BOLD fMRI showed the strongest mean signal increase in Layer I. Our data suggest that fQSM demonstrates less bias towards activation in superficial layers compared to BOLD fMRI. Moreover, activation-based susceptibility change was comparable to VASO data. Studying whole-brain, layer-dependent activation with submillimeter fQSM is feasible, and reduces bias towards venous drainage effects on the cortical surface compared to BOLD fMRI, thereby enabling better localization of laminar activation.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.612757","title":"Brain-wide microstrokes affect the stability of memory circuits in the hippocampus","authors":"Heiser, H.; Kiessler, F.; Roggenbach, A.; Ibanez, V.; Wieckhorst, M.; Helmchen, F.; Gjorgjieva, J.; Wahl, A.-S.","author_corresponding":"Anna-Sophia Wahl","author_corresponding_institution":"Institute for Stroke and Dementia Research (ISD), LMU University Hospital, LMU Munich, Feodor-Lynen-Strasse 17, 81377 Munich, Germany","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.17.612757.source.xml","abstract":"Cognitive deficits affect over 70% of stroke survivors, yet the mechanisms by which multiple small ischemic events contribute to cognitive decline remain poorly understood.

Our findings reveal that, under normal conditions, hippocampal neurons exhibit varying degrees of stability in their spatial memory coding. However, microstrokes disrupted this functional network architecture, leading to cognitive impairments. Notably, the preservation of stable coding place cells, along with the stability, precision, and persistence of the hippocampal network, was strongly predictive of cognitive outcomes.

Fruit flies harbour an innate immune system of which the most populous blood cell (haemocyte) type bears striking homology to the vertebrate macrophage. The importance of these cells has been demonstrated previously, where immune and developmental phenotypes have been observed upon haemocyte ablation using pro-apoptotic transgenes driven by the Hml promoter. Here we show that, as well as ablating Hml-positive cells in vivo using the pro-apoptotic transgene bax, we can also increase Hml-positive cell numbers using a constitutively-active form of ras. However, in adults, compared to larvae, total blood cell numbers were not significantly affected by experimental expansion or ablation. This therefore implies the existence of feedback mechanisms which regulate the number of haemocytes. No effect on lifespan was observed from driving ras and bax in Hml-positive cells using a conditional genetic system (Hml-GeneSwitch). Using a constitutive driver system, we did observe differences in lifespan, however we attribute this to differences in genetic background that could have led to spurious conclusions. Additionally, no effect of either transgene was observed upon infection with two different bacterial species, although a striking pupal lethality phenotype was observed upon expansion of Hml-positive cells in the context of a self-encapsulation mutant genetic background. The latter confirms that the change in Hml-positive cell number does result in a phenotype. The lack of adult phenotypes could be due to the strength of our experimental manipulation or due to compensation via feedback mechanisms that operate to maintain total blood cell numbers. Our study demonstrates the importance of a conditional approach to modulate haemocyte cell numbers in vivo which allows for more precise study of innate immune system function. This approach could be especially fruitful to uncover the mechanisms that regulate total blood cell numbers across development and ageing.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613538","title":"The tilt illusion arises from an efficient reallocation of neural coding resources at the contextual boundary","authors":"Zhang, L.-Q.; Mao, J.; Aguirre, G.

While the tilt illusion has been the subject of quantitative study for over 85 years, we still lack a comprehensive account of the phenomenon that connects its neural and behavioral characteristics. Here, we demonstrate that the tilt illusion originates from a dynamic change in neural coding precision induced by the surround context. We simultaneously obtained psychophysical and fMRI responses from human subjects while they viewed gratings in the absence and presence of an oriented surround, and extracted sensory encoding precision from their behavioral and neural data. Both measures show that in the absence of a surround, encoding reflects the natural scene statistics of orientation. However, in the presence of an oriented surround, encoding precision is significantly increased for stimuli similar to the surround orientation. This local change in encoding is sufficient to accurately predict the behavioral characteristics of the tilt illusion using a Bayesian observer model. The effect of surround modulation increases along the ventral stream, and is localized to the portion of the visual cortex with receptive fields at the center-surround boundary. The pattern of change in coding accuracy reflects the surround-conditioned orientation statistics in natural scenes, but cannot be explained by local stimulus configuration. Our results suggest that the tilt illusion naturally emerges from a dynamic coding strategy that efficiently reallocates neural coding resources based on the current stimulus context.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613562","title":"Predictive filtering of sensory response via orbitofrontal top-down input","authors":"Tsukano, H.; Garcia, M.

The results provide a minimum safe distance of 5 mm between the STA and the frontotemporal branches of the FN at the level of the low edge of zygoma and 8mm between the low edge of zygoma and the FN trunk, providing a pre-auricular triangle of safety for incisions and injections. Variability between subjects was up to 60%.

Here we use cell-attached recordings from UBCs in acute cerebellar slices to examine responses to MF firing patterns that are based on in vivo recordings. We find that MFs evoke a continuum of responses in the UBC population, mediated by three different types of glutamate receptors that each convey a specialized component. AMPARs transmit timing information for single stimuli at up to 5 spikes\/s, and for very brief bursts. A combination of mGluR2\/3s (inhibitory) and mGluR1s (excitatory) mediates a continuum of delayed, and broadened responses to longer bursts, and to sustained high frequency activation. Variability in the mGluR2\/3 component controls the time course of the onset of firing, and variability in the mGluR1 component controls the duration of prolonged firing. We conclude that the combination of glutamate receptor types allows each UBC to simultaneously convey different aspects of MF firing. These findings establish that UBCs are highly flexible circuit elements that provide diverse temporal transformations that are well suited to contribute to specialized processing in different regions of the cerebellar cortex.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613524","title":"A dopaminergic basis of behavioral control","authors":"Ballard, I.

These projections to and from the viscera play an essential role in maintaining and finetuning organ responses in order to sustain homeostasis and allostasis. Functional maps of brain regions participating in this bidirectional communication have been previously studied in awake humans and anesthetized rodents. To further refine the mechanistic understanding of visceral influence on brain states, however, new paradigms that allow for more invasive, and ultimately more informative, measurements and perturbations must be explored. Further, such paradigms should prioritize human translatability. In the current paper, we address these issues by demonstrating the feasibility of non-anesthetized animal imaging during visceral manipulation. More specifically, we used a barostat interfaced with an implanted gastric balloon to cyclically induce distension of a non-anesthetized rat's stomach during simultaneous BOLD fMRI. General linear modeling and spatial independent component analysis revealed several regions with BOLD activation temporally coincident with the gastric distension stimulus. The ON-OFF (20 mmHg - 0 mmHg) barostat-balloon pressure cycle resulted in widespread BOLD activation of the inferior colliculus, cerebellum, ventral midbrain, and a variety of hippocampal structures. These results suggest that neuroimaging models of gastric manipulation in the non-anesthetized rat are achievable and provide an avenue for more comprehensive studies involving the integration of other neuroscience techniques like electrophysiology.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613444","title":"Sex-specific maladaptive responses to acute stress upon in utero THC exposure are mediated by dopamine","authors":"Serra, V.; Traccis, F.; Aroni, S.; Vidal Palencia, L.; Concas, L.; Serra, M.; Leone, R.; Porcu, P.; Busquets-Garcia, A.; Frau, R.; Melis, M.","author_corresponding":"Miriam Melis","author_corresponding_institution":"University of Cagliari","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.17.613444.source.xml","abstract":"Cannabis remains by far the most consumed illicit drug in Europe.

We report a sex-dependent compromised balance in mRNA levels of genes encoding mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in the VTA, alongside with stress-induced prepulse inhibition (PPI) deficits. Notably, VTA dopamine neuronal activity is required for the manifestation of stress-dependent deterioration of PPI. Finally, pharmacological manipulations targeting glycogen-synthase-kinase-3-beta signaling during postnatal development correct these stress-induced, sex-specific and dopamine-dependent deficits of PPI. Collectively, these results highlight the critical sex-dependent interplay between HPA axis and dopamine system in the regulation of sensorimotor gating functions in rats.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613560","title":"Comparison of Explainable AI Models for MRI-based Alzheimer's Disease Classification","authors":"Chattopadhyay, T.; Joshy, N.

However, the neural mechanisms by which the brain regulates dominance hierarchies remain inadequately understood. Considering that GABAergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) exert substantial inhibitory control over serotonergic firing, which may be implicated in the acquisition of dominance, we hypothesized that DRN GABAergic neurons may play a pivotal role in regulating social hierarchy. To test this hypothesis, we employed a combination of optogenetics, chemogenetics, fiber photometry recordings, and behavioral assays in mice, to elucidate the functional contributions of these neurons. Our results revealed a biphasic activity pattern of DRN GABAergic neurons, characterized by increased firing during retreats and decreased firing during push-initiation in the tube test. Furthermore, the optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of DRN GABAergic neurons led to an increase in the number of retreats and a reduction in social rank, while inhibition of these neurons produced the opposite effects. These findings elucidate the bidirectional regulatory role of DRN GABAergic neurons in social hierarchies.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613040","title":"Amygdala stimulation transforms short-term memory into remote memory by persistent activation of atypical PKC in the anterior cingulate cortex","authors":"Almaguer-Melian, W.; Merceron-Martinez, D.; Alacan-Ricardo, L.; Pina, A.

In the context of stress, genetic deletion of glucocorticoid receptors in lateral hypothalamic astrocytes rescued the effects of stress on orexin neuron firing, restoring activity to control levels in both males and females.

Recent advances in motion tracking have streamlined the study of behavior in small laboratory animals and enabled precise movement quantification on fast (millisecond) timescales. This includes markerless keypoint trackers, which utilize deep network systems to label positions of interest on the surface of an animal (e.g., paws, snout, tail, etc.). These approaches mark a major technological achievement. However, they have a high error rate relative to motion capture in humans and are yet to be benchmarked against ground truth datasets in mice. Moreover, the extent to which they can be used to track joint or skeletal kinematics remains unclear. As the primary output of the motor system is the activation of muscles that, in turn, exert forces on the skeleton rather than the skin, it is important to establish potential limitations of techniques that rely on surface imaging. This can be accomplished by imaging implanted fiducial markers in freely moving mice. Here, we present a novel tracking method called QD-Pi (Quantum Dot-based Pose estimation in vivo), which employs injectable near-infrared fluorescent nanoparticles (quantum dots, QDs) immobilized on microbeads. We demonstrate that the resulting tags are biocompatible and can be imaged non-invasively using commercially available camera systems when injected into fatty tissue beneath the skin or directly into joints. Using this technique, we accurately capture 3D trajectories of up to ten independent internal positions in freely moving mice over multiple weeks. Finally, we leverage this technique to create a large-scale ground truth dataset for benchmarking and training the next generation of markerless keypoint tracker systems.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613425","title":"Activation of 5-HT7 receptors in the mouse dentate gyrus selectively enhances GABAergic inhibition of hilar mossy cells without affecting plasticity at the perforant path synapse","authors":"Siwiec, M.; Bobula, B.; Kielbinski, M.; Multan, N.; Hess, G.; Tokarski, K.","author_corresponding":"Marcin Siwiec","author_corresponding_institution":"Department of Physiology, Maj Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences, Smetna 12 Str., 31-343 Krakow, Poland","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.17.613425.source.xml","abstract":"Background: The study examined the effects of 5-HT7 receptor activation on GABAergic transmission within the dentate gyrus and plasticity at the glutamatergic perforant path input. Methods: Immunofluorescence imaging was performed using transverse hippocampal slices from transgenic mice expressing GFP under the Htr7 promoter. This was followed by whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiological recordings of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents recorded from dentate granule cells and hilar mossy cells -- two glutamatergic neuron types present in the dentate gyrus. Extracellular recordings of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials were then performed to assess whether 5-HT7 receptor activation influenced theta burst stimulation-evoked plasticity of the perforant path synaptic input. Results: It was found that parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons in the dentate gyrus expressed GFP. Activation of 5-HT7 receptors increased GABAergic transmission targeting mossy cells but not granule cells. However, there was no effect of 5-HT7 receptor activation on perforant path plasticity either with intact or blocked GABAA receptor signaling. Conclusion: The presence of 5-HT7 receptors in a subset of parvalbumin and somatostatin interneurons in the mouse dentate gyrus could mean that they are involved in the inhibitory control of dentate gyrus activity, although the effect seems to be confined to mossy cells and did not translate to changes in perforant path plasticity. Further experiments are needed to fully elucidate the functional role of these receptors in the dentate gyrus.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613513","title":"Overabundant endocannabinoids in neurons are detrimental to cognitive function","authors":"Zhu, D.; Zhang, J.; Ma, X.; Hu, M.; Gao, F.; Hashem, J.; Lyu, J.; Wei, J.; Cui, Y.; Qiu, S.; Chen, C.","author_corresponding":"Chu Chen","author_corresponding_institution":"UT Health San Antonio","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nd","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.17.613513.source.xml","abstract":"2-Arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) is the most prevalent endocannabinoid involved in maintaining brain homeostasis. Previous studies have demonstrated that inactivating monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme responsible for degrading 2-AG in the brain, alleviates neuropathology and prevents synaptic and cognitive decline in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. However, we show that selectively inhibiting 2-AG metabolism in neurons impairs cognitive function in mice. This cognitive impairment appears to result from decreased expression of synaptic proteins and synapse numbers, impaired long-term synaptic plasticity and cortical circuit functional connectivity, and diminished neurogenesis. Interestingly, the synaptic and cognitive deficits induced by neuronal MAGL inactivation can be counterbalanced by inhibiting astrocytic 2-AG metabolism. Transcriptomic analyses reveal that inhibiting neuronal 2-AG degradation leads to widespread changes in expression of genes associated with synaptic function. These findings suggest that crosstalk in 2-AG signaling between astrocytes and neurons is crucial for maintaining synaptic and cognitive functions and that excessive 2-AG in neurons alone is detrimental to cognitive function.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613495","title":"Notch\/Hairless Pathway Modulation of sog Transcriptional Bursting in Prelude to Gastrulation","authors":"Fenelon, K.

It is believed that this effect is a byproduct of how the neural substrate responsible for motion perception is organized. The structure of the motion perception circuitry is widespread across the animal kingdom, vertebrates and invertebrates alike, which in turn causes the illusion effect to be experienced by virtually all animals. Among invertebrates, jumping spiders possess a unique visual system. For them, the tasks of visual computation are split across 4 pairs of eyes, with motion detection, target recognition, and shape discrimination computed in completely segregated brain areas and visual field sections. In such an organization, it is unlikely that the circuitry for motion perception common to other animals is shared by jumping spiders. Consequently, jumping spiders should be immune to the peripheral drift illusion. To test this hypothesis, we placed jumping spiders on top of an omnidirectional treadmill and presented them with circular visual stimuli in their visual periphery. These were either composed of a sawtooth pattern, and therefore inducing the illusion, or of a sine-wave pattern of equal luminance and spatial frequency but not illusion-inducing. The stimuli could either be static or rotate around their center, either clockwise or counterclockwise. As jumping spiders perform distinctive full-body pivots when detecting a moving object in their visual periphery, we registered the frequency of this behavior to assess the illusory percept. We found that the spiders responded consistently to all moving stimuli, but did not react to the static illusion, therefore it was not perceived as in motion. The absence of the illusory percept in spiders opens many questions about the nature of their motion perception circuitry and casts doubts on how the illusion is widespread in the animal kingdom outside the common model species usually inquired about.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613492","title":"Enhanced conspicuousness of prey in warmer water mitigates the visual constraint of turbidity for predators","authors":"Zanghi, C.; Troscianko, J.; Ioannou, C.

We quantified the detectability of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) free-swimming in a large arena from the perspective of a stationary visual predator (simulated as an underwater camera). We used a fully factorial experimental design testing the independent and combined effects of increased temperature and turbidity. We found that both stressors had a strong influence on the appearance of prey (objectively quantified as the mean magnitude of the optical flow in the videos). As expected, turbidity reduced the frequency of detection between the guppies and the simulated predator, i.e. the magnitude of optical flow exceeded the threshold for a 'detection event' more often in clear water. Events were also shorter in duration in turbid water, reducing the time available for a predator to detect the prey. However, during an event, prey were more detectable in warmer water (i.e. the mean magnitude was greater). Although we found no evidence of interactive effects of turbidity and temperature on the response variables, their cumulative main effects suggest an antagonistic effect on the overall rate of prey capture.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613410","title":"Limbic System White Matter in Children and Adolescents with ADHD: A Longitudinal Diffusion MRI Analysis","authors":"Connaughton, M.; Leemans, A.; Silk, T.

Using ecologically relevant ''approach food-avoid predator'' paradigms, we revealed that 5XFAD mice display impaired decision strategies in risky foraging tasks, characterized by rigid hippocampal place fields and diminished sharp-wave ripple (SWR) frequencies, accompanied by disrupted prefrontal-hippocampal connectivity. These neural deficits align with behavioral inflexibility in dynamic threat scenarios. Our findings indicate that disrupted SWR dynamics and corticolimbic connectivity contribute to decision-making deficits in AD, emphasizing the potential of targeting these specific neural mechanisms to ameliorate cognitive impairments.

Such trial-to-trial response variabilities are often treated as noise and addressed by simple trial-averaging to obtain the stimulus-driven response, though this approach is insufficient to fully remove the response variability. More importantly, there is evidence that response variability may primarily be caused by non-sensory factors, particularly by variations in cortical state. Here we recorded and analyzed neuronal spiking activity in response to natural images from areas 17 and 18 of cats, along with local population neuronal signals; local field potential (LFP) and multi-unit activity (MUA). We used a variability ratio (VR) measure to quantify the variability of neural responses across trials and two cortical state indicative measures; global fluctuation index (GFI) calculated using MUA and synchrony index (SI) calculated using LFP signals. We propose a compact convolutional neural network model with two parallel pathways, to capture the stimulus-driven activity and the cortical state-driven response variabilities. The stimulus-driven pathway contains a spatiotemporal filter, a parametric rectifier and a Gaussian map and the cortical state-driven pathway contains temporal filters for MUA and LFP. The model parameters are fit to best predict the spiking activity of each neuron. Single neurons showed highly varying degrees of trial-to-trial response variability, even when recorded simultaneously. The fitted model performed with a significantly higher accuracy in predicting neural responses compared to a basic model with a stimulus-driven pathway alone. The neurons with higher response variability benefited more from the cortical state-driven pathway compared to less variable neurons. These results provide insights to understanding the possibility of trial-to-trial response variabilities emerging as an effect of cortical state dynamics.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.612994","title":"Interaction between facial expression and color in modulating EPR P3","authors":"Hasegawa, Y.; Tamura, H.; Nakauchi, S.; Minami, T.","author_corresponding":"Tetsuto Minami","author_corresponding_institution":"Toyohashi University of Technology","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"neuroscience","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.16.612994.source.xml","abstract":"The relationships between facial expression and color affect human cognition functions such as perception and memory. However, whether these relationships influence attention remains unclear. Additionally, whether facial expressions affect selective attention is unknown; for example, reddish angry faces increase negative social evaluation or emotion intensity, but it is unclear whether selective attention is similarly enhanced. To investigate these questions, we examined whether event-related potentials for faces vary depending on facial expression and color by recording electroencephalography (EEG) data. We conducted an oddball task using stimuli that combined facial expressions (angry, neutral) and facial colors (original, red, green). The participants counted the number of times a rarely appearing target face stimulus appeared among the standard face stimuli. The results indicated that the difference in P3 amplitudes for the target and standard faces depended on the combinations of facial expressions and facial colors; the P3 amplitudes for red angry faces were greater than those for red neutral faces. Additionally, there was no significant main effect or interaction effect of facial expression or facial color on P1 amplitudes for the target, and there were significant main effects of facial expression only on the N170 amplitude. These findings suggest that the intensity of a human's selective attention to facial expressions varies according to the higher-order semantic processing of the relationship between emotion and color rather than simple facial expression or facial color effects individually. Our results support the idea that red color increases the human response to anger from an EEG perspective.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.613292","title":"MPXV Infects Human PBMCs in a Type I Interferon-Sensitive Manner","authors":"Bosquillon de Jarcy, L.; Postmus, D.; Jansen, J.; Melchert, J.; Hoffmann, D.; Corman, V.

This pandemic outbreak was driven by the MPXV variant Clade IIb. In addition, Clade I viruses circulating in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are drawing increased attention as cases constantly rise and Clade Ib, first identified in 2023, is now co-circulating with Clade Ia and seems to exhibit enhanced human-to-human transmissibility. While most infected individuals display a self-limiting disease with singular pox-like lesions, some endure systemic viral spread leading to whole-body rash with risks for necrosis, organ loss, and death. Intra-host dissemination and cellular tropism of MPXV are largely unexplored in humans. To establish a potential susceptibility of circulating immune cells to MPXV, we exposed human PBMCs from healthy donors ex vivo to a currently circulating MPXV clade IIb virus isolate in absence and presence of IFN-2a. qPCR of DNA extracted from cell lysates, but less from supernatants, revealed increasing MPXV DNA quantities that peaked at five to six days post-exposure, suggesting susceptibility of PBMCs to infection. IFN-2a pretreatment markedly reduced the quantity of MPXV DNA, suggesting that infection is sensitive to type I IFNs. Plaque assays from supernatants showed that infection gave rise to de novo production of infectious MPXV. In virus-inclusive scRNA-sequencing, monocytes, cycling NK cells and regulatory CD4+ T-cells scored positive for viral RNA, suggesting that these are the MPXV-susceptible cell types within the human PBMC population. Analysis of differentially expressed genes displayed a pronounced downregulation of expression pathways driving innate immunity in MPXV-infected cells, a well-established feature of poxviral infection. Pretreatment of PBMCs with current antivirals Cidofovir and Tecovirimat resulted in reduced amounts of viral antigen production and of released infectivity, suggesting suitability of the human PBMC infection model as a platform for evaluation of current and future antivirals and justifying trials to investigate Cidofovir and Tecovirimat as drugs reducing intra-patient viral spread. Together, our data suggest that human PBMCs are productively infected by MPXV which is accompanied by significant modulation of the cellular milieu. Our results have the potential to illuminate aspects of intra-host propagation of MPXV that may involve a lymphohematogenous route for replication and\/or intra-host dissemination.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.16.613250","title":"Affinity tag free purification of SARS-Cov-2 N protein and its crystal structure in complex with ssDNA","authors":"Maiti, A.; Matsuo, H.","author_corresponding":"Atanu Maiti","author_corresponding_institution":"Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_no","category":"biochemistry","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.16.613250.source.xml","abstract":"The nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the four structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2, playing key roles in viral assembly, immune evasion, and stability.

Compared to other SARS-CoV-2 components, the N protein has several advantages: higher sequence conservation, lower mutation rates, and stronger immunogenicity, making it an attractive target for antiviral drug development and diagnostics.

A natural theoretical question is how to formalize the computational problem of building an optimal pangenome graph, making explicit the underlying optimization criterion and the set of feasible solutions. Current approaches build a pangenome graph with some heuristics, without assuming some explicit optimization criteria. Thus it is unclear how a specific optimization criterion affects the graph topology and downstream analysis, like read mapping and variant calling. Methods: In this paper, by leveraging the notion of maximal block in a Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA), we reframe the pangenome graph construction problem as an exact cover problem on blocks called Minimum Weighted Block Cover (MWBC). Then we propose an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation for the MWBC problem that allows us to study the most natural objective functions for building a graph. Results: We provide an implementation of the ILP approach for solving the MWBC and we evaluate it on SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes, showing how different objective functions lead to pangenome graphs that have different properties, hinting that the specific downstream task can drive the graph construction phase. Conclusion: We show that a customized construction of a pangenome graph based on selecting objective functions has a direct impact on the resulting graphs. In particular, our formalization of the MWBC problem, based on finding an optimal subset of blocks covering an MSA, paves the way to novel practical approaches to graph representations of an MSA where the user can guide the construction.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613456","title":"Metabolite-responsive Control of Transcription by Phase Separation-based Synthetic Organelles","authors":"Jerez-Longres, C.; Weber, W.","author_corresponding":"Wilfried Weber","author_corresponding_institution":"INM - Leibniz Institute for New Materials","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_no","category":"synthetic biology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.17.613456.source.xml","abstract":"Living natural materials have remarkable sensing abilities that translate external cues into functional changes of the material. The reconstruction of such sensing materials in bottom-up synthetic biology provides the opportunity to develop synthetic materials with life-like sensing and adaptation ability. Key to such functions are material modules that translate specific input signals into a biomolecular response. Here, we engineer a synthetic organelle based on liquid-liquid phase separation that translates a metabolic signal into the regulation of gene transcription. To this aim, we engineer the pyruvate-dependent repressor PdhR to undergo liquid-liquid phase separation in vitro by fusion to intrinsically disordered regions. We demonstrate that the resulting coacervates bind DNA harbouring PdhR-responsive operator sites in a pyruvate dose-dependent and reversible manner. We observed that the activity of transcription units on the DNA was strongly attenuated following recruitment to the coacervates. However, the addition of pyruvate resulted in a reversible and dose-dependent reconstitution of transcriptional activity. The coacervate-based synthetic organelles linking metabolic cues to transcriptional signals represent a materials approach to confer stimulus-responsiveness to minimal bottom-up synthetic biological systems and open opportunities in materials for sensor applications.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613466","title":"A modular system for programming multistep activation of endogenous genes in stem cells","authors":"Puppala, A.

An interesting result of such membrane-lipid interplay is the reorganization of lipid domains together with membrane-bound proteins at the onset of cell division, suggesting a functional significance of membrane compartments in the cell cycle. Here, by adopting the key bacterial division proteins MinCDE and FtsZ as an archetypal spatial patterning system, we present a simple vesicle-based in vitro model to explore the mutual dependence of protein pattern formation and membrane heterogeneity. Like many other peripheral membrane proteins, MinDE exhibit preferential binding and macro-scale pattern formation at Ld domains, which leads to altered oscillation mode selection in phase-separated membrane compartments (GUVs). Moreover, incorporating bacterial division proteins within phase-separated GUVs leads to blebbing-like membrane deformations followed by the reorganization of Lo domains aligning at the neck region of the bleb, which agrees well with the domain rearrangement in bacterial membranes immediately preceding the radial constriction process. Overall, the presented in vitro model system showcases a basic framework to better comprehend the cellular division mechanism in consideration of complex cellular lipid environments.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612619","title":"Intravital imaging of pulmonary lymphatics in inflammation and metastatic cancer","authors":"Cleary, S.

Yet whole genome analysis has only been carried out on few strains of L. borgpetersenii, with limited closed genomes and comprehensive analysis. Herein we report the complete, circularized genomes of seven non-Hardjo Leptospira borgpetersenii isolates from human leptospirosis patients in Sri Lanka.

Our understanding of A. baumannii respiratory pathogenesis relies on an acute murine infection model with limited clinical relevance that employs an unnaturally high number of bacteria and requires the assessment of bacterial load at 24-36 hours post-infection. Here, we demonstrate that low intranasal inoculums in immunocompromised mice with a tlr4 mutation leads to reduced inflammation, allowing for persistent infections lasting at least 3 weeks. Using this chronic infection model, we determined the adhesin InvL is an imperative virulence factor required during later stages of infection, despite being dispensable in the early phase. We also demonstrate that the chronic model enables the distinction between antibiotics that, although initially reduce bacterial burden, either lead to complete clearance or result in the formation of bacterial persisters. To illustrate how our model can be applied to study polymicrobial infections, we inoculated mice with an active A. baumannii infection with Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae. We found that S. aureus exacerbates the infection, while K. pneumoniae enhances A. baumannii clearance.

For bioaccumulating Bacteroides uniformis, a highly prevalent species, we estimate intracellular PFAS concentration in the mM range - above that of most native metabolites.

Endospores of this gram-positive bacterium enter the intestinal tract via faecal-oral transmission, germinate into vegetative and toxin-producing cells and can trigger a Clostridioides difficile infection. The microaerophilic conditions (0.1 to 0.4 % O2) of the large intestine represent a challenge for the strictly anaerobic organism, which protects itself by a variety of oxidative stress proteins. Four of these are encoded in an operon that is assumed to be involved in the detoxification of H2O2 and O2[bullet]-. This operon encodes a rubrerythrin (rbr), its own transcriptional repressor PerR (perR), a desulfoferrodoxin (rbo) and a putative glutamate dehydrogenase (CD630_08280) with an N-terminal rubredoxin domain, which is only expressed under high oxidative stress conditions. In this study, the enzyme activity of Rbr, Rbo and CD630_08280 was tested in-vitro. Recombinant proteins were overexpressed in C. difficile and purified anaerobically by affinity chromatography.

Furthermore, Rbo was verified as a O2[bullet]- reductase and its activity compared to the superoxide dismutase of E. coli. The investigated gene locus codes for an oxidative stress operon whose members are able to completely neutralize O2[bullet]- and H2O2 to water and could thus be vital for C. difficile to establish an infection in the host.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613397","title":"Title Longitudinal Observational (single cohort) Study on the Causes of Trypanocide Failure in cases of African Animal Trypanosomosis in Cattle Near Wildlife Protected Areas of Northern Tanzania","authors":"Richards, S.; Pagnossin, D.; Buyugu, P.

Trypanocides can be used for both treatment and prophylaxis, but failure is often reported; this may occur due to resistance, substandard drugs, or inappropriate administration. This study in Tanzania aims to quantify reasons for trypanocide failure. An observational year-long longitudinal study was conducted in high-risk AAT areas in Serengeti District from December 2019-October 2022. Purposive sampling targeted herds with high utilization of the prophylactic trypanocide isometamidium chloride (ISM). When a farmer administered a trypanocide (ISM, diminazine aceturate, homidium), the project veterinarian assessed administration and treatment outcomes were determined based on PCR results from blood samples. A multivariable mixed model was utilized to evaluate risk factors for prophylaxis failure. Quality analysis was performed on trypanocide samples using High Performance Liquid Chromatography. A total of 630 cattle from 21 farms were monitored for a year-long period. A total of 295 trypanocide administrations were reported, predominantly being ISM (56%) used for prophylaxis (87%). One-third of trypanocide administrations were not given adequately, and many trypanocides were given to animals that tested negative for trypanosome infections by PCR. Failures occurred in 7% (95% CI 3.0-14%) of curative treatments, and 44% (95% CI 35-42%) of prophylactic administrations. The brand of ISM was significantly associated with odds of prophylaxis failure (p = 0.011). On quality analysis, two ISM samples had no detectable ISM isomers, but the remainder of ISM and DA samples (n=46) fell within the range of acceptable levels. Drug counterfeiting, inadequate use of trypanocides, and resistance are all contributing to trypanocide failure, limiting effective AAT control and with implications for human disease risk. In order to curb trypanocide failure a multi-modal approach to managing the use of trypanocides is required to address all contributing factors.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613553","title":"RNA Polymerase II coordinates histone deacetylation at active promoters","authors":"Hoffman, J.

Transcription initiation was dispensable for de novo and steady-state histone acetylation at transcription start sites (TSSs) and enhancers. However, at steady state, blocking transcription initiation increased the levels of histone acetylation and H2AZ incorporation at active TSSs. These results demonstrate that deposition of specific histone modifications at TSSs is not dependent on transcription and that transcription limits the maintenance of these marks.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.612794","title":"Structural insight into the nuclear transportation mechanism of PPARg by Transportin-1","authors":"TOMA-FUKAI, S.; Nakamura, Y.; Kawamoto, A.; Shimizu, H.; Hayama, K.; Kojima, R.; Yoshimura, K.; Ishii, M.; Hirose, M.; Teratani, T.; Ohata, S.; Kato, T.; Kamikubo, H.; Itoh, T.; Tomita, K.; Shimizu, T.","author_corresponding":"Sachiko TOMA-FUKAI","author_corresponding_institution":"Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_no","category":"molecular biology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.17.612794.source.xml","abstract":"The spatial and temporal control of protein is essential for normal cellular function.

The proteasome is considered one of the major systems that degrades misfolded, including ND-associated, proteins, thereby acting to reduce aggregation, while inhibition of the proteasome increases aggregation. Unexpectedly, we found that proteasome inhibitor treatment significantly reduced ALS-associated mutant FUS aggregation in cells and in primary neurons. This is in sharp contrast to most other ND-associated aggregating proteins, including Huntingtin and TDP-43, for which proteasome inhibitors enhanced aggregation. We further found that this inhibitory effect is dependent on the transcription factor HSF1, suggesting that the underlying mechanism of this effect is transcriptionally-mediated. Since heat shock treatment did not show any effect on FUS aggregation, we hypothesized that proteasome inhibitors elicit a transcriptional program distinct of that of heat shock, which is protective of FUS aggregation. We identified BAG3, a co-chaperone that cooperates with HSP70 in reducing FUS aggregation, as a significant mediator of this effect. We therefore propose BBB-permeable proteasome inhibitors as a potential therapy specific to ALS-FUS.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613413","title":"Enhancing lysosome function via mTOR\/TFEB activation reduces lipofuscin-like granules in early Age-related Macular Degeneration","authors":"Falcao, A.

Although the exact causes of AMD are not clear, the primary origin of pathology appears to be in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). RPE is responsible for the daily digestion of photoreceptor outer segments (POS), which imposes a heavy continuous burden on the lysosomal network. POS feeding assay in vitro suggested that the accumulation of autofluorescence granules (AFG), similar to lipofuscin in vivo, derives from lysosomal dysfunction. Here we show that synchronous phagocytosis of POS leads to early transient mTOR activation followed by inhibition in late phagosome maturation. One of its substrates, the transcription factor EB (TFEB) increases during phagosome maturation albeit mostly in its inactive phosphorylated form. We questioned whether induction of the mTOR\/TFEB axis could improve digestion of POS and hence reduce AFG load. Treatment of POS-fed cells with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor after the appearance of AFG results in 30% reduction of AFG load. This effect is dependent on active lysosomal enzymes and induction of active dephosphorylated TFEB with consequent activation of GADD34 and lysosomal biogenesis. As a proof of concept, we show that overexpressing a constitutively active form of unphosphorylated TFEB dramatically reduces POS-dependent AFG accumulation. Overall, this study suggests that viral or pharmacological approaches activating the mTOR\/TFEB axis in the RPE could be beneficial as cell-protective treatment of early\/intermediate cases of AMD, acting to delay progression of the disease.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613497","title":"pytom-match-pick: a tophat-transform constraint for automated classification in template matching","authors":"Chaillet, M.

We benchmarked pytom-match-pick on public datasets, demonstrating improved classification and localization of macromolecules like ribosomal subunits and proteasomes that led to fewer artifacts in subtomogram averages.

These samples were screened for evidence of current (RNA) or past (IgG antibodies) Ebola virus infections.

Furthermore, over 50% of respondents reported frequent visits to the forest to hunt a variety of wild animals, particularly ungulates and rodents, which could account for occasional viral spillovers. The absence of active Ebola virus circulation in wildlife may reflect seasonal patterns in reservoir ecology, like those observed in bats. Similarly, seasonal human activities, like hunting and foraging, may result in periodic exposure risks. These findings highlight the importance of continuous, multidisciplinary surveillance to monitor changes in seasonal spillover risks.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612448","title":"Integrating intraspecific variation into population dynamics reveals how interacting species persist in mutualistic communities","authors":"Arroyo-Correa, B.; Bartomeus, I.; Jordano, P.; Cagua, E.

Yet the study of community dynamics often relies on values averaged at the species level, ignoring how intraspecific variation can affect those dynamics. We propose a theoretical framework for evaluating the extent to which various forms of variation within populations can influence species' persistence in mutualistic systems. Next, drawing from detailed empirical data on plant-pollinator interactions and plant fitness, we quantify intraspecific variation in the mutualistic benefits received by plants and incorporate this variation into estimations of the community's structural stability, a robust theoretical measure of species' likelihood of persistence. Through explicit consideration of intraspecific variation, we are able to demonstrate that having different combinations of specialized and generalized individuals within plant populations promotes the persistence of pollinator communities. Further, we find that these heterogeneous mixtures of plant individuals reduce the probability of exclusion of focal plant species by promoting indirect effects across the broader plant-pollinator community. By providing a framework that explicitly accounts for individual-level variation, we open the door to a better understanding of the mechanisms promoting biodiversity in mutualistic communities and beyond.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612725","title":"Local adaptation to climate facilitates a global invasion","authors":"Gamba, D.; BromeCast Network,  ; Lasky, J.

Here, we introduce the largest collection of ancient Portuguese genomic datasets (n = 68) to date, spanning 5,000 years, from the Neolithic to the 19th century. Results: We found evidence of patrilocality in Neolithic Portugal, with admixture from local hunter-gatherers and Anatolian farmers, and persistence of Upper Paleolithic Magdalenian ancestry. This genetic profile persists into the Chalcolithic, reflecting diverse local hunter-gatherer contributions. During the Bronze Age, local genetic ancestry persisted, particularly in southern Iberia, despite influences from the North Pontic Steppe and early Mediterranean contacts. The Roman period highlights Idanha-a-Velha as a hub of migration and interaction, with a notably diverse genetic profile. The Early Medieval period is marked by Central European ancestry linked to Suebi\/Visigoth migrations, adding to coeval local, African, and Mediterranean influences. The Islamic and Christian Conquest periods show strong genetic continuity in northern Portugal and significant African admixture in the south, with persistent Jewish and Islamic ancestries suggesting enduring influences in the post-Islamic period. Conclusions: This study represents the first attempt to reconstruct the genetic history of Portugal from the analysis of ancient individuals. We reveal dynamic patterns of migration and cultural exchange across millennia, but also the persistence of local ancestries. Our findings integrate genetic information with historical and archaeological data, enhancing our understanding of Iberia's ancient heritage.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612702","title":"Capturing sclera anisotropy using direct collagen fiber models.

Recently we introduced a direct fiber modeling approach for sclera based on representing the long interwoven fibers. Our method differs from the conventional continuum approach to modeling sclera that homogenizes the fibers and describes them as statistical distributions for each element. At large scale our method captured gross collagen fiber bundle architecture from histology and experimental intraocular pressure-induced deformations. At small scale, a direct fiber model of a sclera sample reproduced equi-biaxial experimental behavior from the literature. In this study our goal was a much more challenging task for the direct fiber modeling: to capture specimen-specific 3D fiber architecture and anisotropic mechanics of four sclera samples tested under equibiaxial and four non-equibiaxial loadings. Samples of sclera from three eyes were isolated and tested in five biaxial loadings following an approach previously reported. Using microstructural architecture from polarized light microscopy we then created specimen-specific direct fiber models. Model fiber orientations agreed well with the histological information (adjusted R2's>0.89). Through an inverse-fitting process we determined model characteristics, including specimen-specific fiber mechanical properties to match equibiaxial loading. Interestingly, the equibiaxial properties also reproduced all the non-equibiaxial behaviors. These results indicate that the direct fiber modeling method naturally accounted for tissue anisotropy within its fiber structure. Direct fiber modeling is therefore a promising approach to understand how macroscopic behavior arises from microstructure.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612723","title":"Precision Repair of Zone-Specific Meniscal Injuries Using a Tunable Extracellular Matrix-Based Hydrogel System","authors":"Lee, S.-H.; Li, Z.; Zhang, E.

By synthesizing age-dependent DEM hydrogels, we identified distinct cellular responses: fetal bovine meniscus-derived DEM promoted chondrogenic differentiation, while adult meniscus-derived DEM supported fibrochondrogenic phenotypes. The incorporation of methacrylate hyaluronic acid (MeHA) further refined the mechanical properties and injectability of the DEM-based hydrogels.

We hypothesized that increasing luminal flow in the CNT induces CNTGF via O2- generation and ENaC activation. Methods: Rabbit afferent arterioles (Af-Arts) with adjacent CNTs were microperfused ex-vivo with variable flow rates and sodium concentrations ranging from <1 mM to 80 mM and from 5 to 40 nL\/min flow rates. Results: Perfusion of the CNT with 5 mM NaCl and increasing flow rates from 5 to 10, 20, and 40 nL\/min caused a flow rate-dependent dilation of the Af-Art (p<0.001). Adding the ENaC blocker benzamil inhibited flow-induced Af-Art dilation, indicating a CNTGF response. In contrast, perfusion of the CNT with <1 mM NaCl did not result in flow-induced CNTGF vasodilation (p>0.05). Multiple linear regression modeling (R2=0.51;p<0.001) demonstrated that tubular flow ({beta}=0.163 {+\/-} 0.04;p<0.001) and sodium concentration ({beta}=0.14 {+\/-} 0.03;p<0.001) are independent variables that induce afferent arteriole vasodilation. Tempol reduced flow-induced CNTGF, and L-NAME did not influence this effect. Conclusion: Increased luminal flow in the CNT induces CNTGF activation via ENaC, partially due to flow-stimulated O2- production and independent of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612679","title":"Implementation of Ribo-BiFC method to plant systems using a split mVenus approach","authors":"Raabe, K.; Naprstkova, A.; Pieters, J.; Torutaeva, E.; Jiraskova, V.; Kahrizi, Z.; Michailidis, C.; Honys, D.","author_corresponding":"Karel Raabe","author_corresponding_institution":"Institute of Experimental Botany of the Czech Academy of Sciences","date":"2024-09-17","version":"1","type":"new results","license":"cc_by_nc_nd","category":"plant biology","jatsxml":"https:\/\/www.biorxiv.org\/content\/early\/2024\/09\/17\/2024.09.12.612679.source.xml","abstract":"Translation is a fundamental process for every living organism. In plants, the rate of translation is tightly modulated during development and in response to environmental cues. However, it is difficult to measure the actual translation state of the tissues in vivo. Here, we report the implementation of an in vivo translation marker based on bimolecular fluorescence complementation, the Ribo-BiFC. We combined method originally developed for fruit-fly with an improved low background split-mVenus BiFC system previously described in plants. We labelled Arabidopsis thaliana small subunit ribosomal protein (RPS) and large subunit ribosomal protein (RPL) with fragments of the mVenus fluorescent protein. Upon the assembly of the 80S ribosome, the mVenus fragments complemented and were detected by fluorescent microscopy. We show that these recombinant proteins are in close proximity in the tobacco epidermal cells, although the signal is reduced when compared to BiFC signal from known interactors. This Ribo-BiFC method system can be used in stable transgenic lines to enable visualisation of translational rate in plant tissues and could be used to study translation dynamics and its changes during plant development, under abiotic stress or in different genetic backgrounds.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613263","title":"Reversible excision of the wzy locus in Salmonella Typhimurium may aid recovery following phage predation","authors":"Charity, O.

An improved understanding of phage-host interactions is therefore needed. The Anderson phage typing scheme differentiates closely related strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) based on sensitivity to a panel of phage preparations. Switches in phage type are indicative of changes in phage sensitivity and inform on the dynamics of phage interaction with their host bacteria. We investigated the molecular basis of switches between the relatively phage sensitive S. Typhimurium DT8 and phage resistant DT30 strains that are present in the same phylogenetic clade. DT30 strains emerged from DT8 strains predominantly by deletion of a genomic region affecting the wzy locus encoding an O-antigen polymerase. The deletion site was flanked by two perfect direct repeats designated attL and attR. During broth culture in the presence of a typing phage that used O-antigen as primary receptor the Deltawzy genotype increased in frequency compared with culture in the absence of phage and removal of attL prevented deletion of the wzy locus. Co-culture of S. Typhimurium DT8 with a strain lacking wzy resulted in reversion of the latter to wild type. We propose a model in which reversible deletion of the wzy locus enables recovery of S. Typhimurium DT8 following predation by phage that use O-antigen as their primary receptor. This was consistent with ancestral state reconstruction of DT8 and DT30 phylogeny that supported a model of reversible transition from DT8 to DT30 in natural populations.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613539","title":"Decoding polyubiquitin regulation of KV7. 1 functional expression with engineered linkage-selective deubiquitinases","authors":"Shanmugam, S.

Functional consequences of diverse polyubiquitin linkages on proteins are mostly unknown, with progress hindered by a lack of methods to specifically tune polyubiquitin linkages on individual proteins in live cells. Here, we bridge this gap by exploiting deubiquitinases (DUBs) with preferences for hydrolyzing different polyubiquitin linkages: OTUD1 - K63; OTUD4 - K48; Cezanne - K11; TRABID - K29\/K33; and USP21 - non-specific. We developed a suite of engineered deubiquitinases (enDUBs) comprised of DUB catalytic domains fused to a GFP-targeted nanobody and used them to investigate polyubiquitin linkage regulation of an ion channel, YFP-KCNQ1. Mass spectrometry of YFP-KCNQ1 expressed in HEK293 cells indicated channel polyubiquitination with K48 (72%) and K63 (24%) linkages being dominant. NEDD4-2 and ITCH both decreased KCNQ1 functional expression but with distinctive polyubiquitination signatures. All enDUBs reduced KCNQ1 ubiquitination but yielded unique effects on channel expression, surface density, ionic currents, and subcellular localization. The pattern of outcomes indicates K11, K29\/K33, and K63 chains mediate net KCNQ1-YFP intracellular retention, but achieved in different ways: K11 promotes ER retention\/degradation, enhances endocytosis, and reduces recycling; K29\/K33 promotes ER retention\/degradation; K63 enhances endocytosis and reduces recycling. The pattern of enDUB effects on KCNQ1-YFP differed in cardiomyocytes, emphasizing ubiquitin code mutability. Surprisingly, enDUB-O4 decreased KCNQ1-YFP surface density suggesting a role for K48 in forward trafficking. Lastly, linkage-selective enDUBs displayed varying capabilities to rescue distinct trafficking-deficient long QT syndrome type 1 mutations. The results reveal distinct polyubiquitin chains control different aspects of KCNQ1 functional expression, demonstrate ubiquitin code plasticity, and introduce linkage-selective enDUBs as a potent tool to help demystify the polyubiquitin code.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.12.612700","title":"Conserved Evolutionary Response to Whole Genome Duplication in Angiosperms Revealed Using High Resolution Gene Expression Profiling","authors":"Leal, J.

Whole genome duplication often triggers significant morphological and ecological changes in autopolyploids vis-a-vis their diploid progenitors, which are induced by subtle changes in gene expression patterns, often of a stochastic nature. Recent results have nonetheless identified specific changes in meiotic, metabolic, and defense response pathways that seem to be commonly shared among autopolyploid species, hinting at convergent evolution. Notably, a set of 12 core meiotic genes, including several genes involved in meiotic crossover formation, has been found to undergo strong selective pressure in the aftermath of autopolyploidization. For the most part these findings have been based on the study of Arabidopsis arenosa and A. lyrata autotetraploids and the question has remained as to whether the evolutionary forces shaping the establishment and evolution of autopolyploidy in the Arabidopsis model system extend more broadly across angiosperms, an area where our knowledge is still limited. In order to address these questions, we conducted a comparative transcriptome analysis of Betula pubescens, a highly introgressed autotetraploid, and its diploid sister species, B. pendula, two birch species belonging to the Fagales order that diverged from Brassicales 120-140 Mya. Our results reveal significant changes in the expression patterns of B. pubescens in genes involved in secondary metabolic processes and the regulation of stress response to pathogens, in agreement with results obtained in other autopolyploid plant complexes. Allele-specific expression analysis identified 16 meiotic genes in B. pubescens with constrained expression patterns, strongly favoring alleles introgressed from B. humilis or B. nana, a set that includes 8 meiotic genes - ASY1, ASY3, PDS5B, PRD3, SYN1, SMC3, SHOC1 and SCC4 - previously found to be under selection in Arabidopsis autopolyploids. These results provide support to the hypothesis that whole genome duplication triggers similar genomic responses across flowering plants, and that the evolutionary path available to autopolyploids for regaining meiotic stability is highly conserved and dependent on a small group of core meiotic genes.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"},{"doi":"10.1101\/2024.09.17.613402","title":"Molecular dynamics simulations of human cohesin subunits identify DNA binding sites and their potential roles in DNA loop extrusion","authors":"Gu, C.; Takada, S.; Brandani, G.

Here, we sought to investigate its mechanism using molecular dynamics simulations. To achieve this, we first constructed the amino-acid-residue-resolution structural models of the cohesin subunits, SMC1, SMC3, STAG1, and NIPBL. By simulating these subunits with double-stranded DNA molecules, we predicted DNA binding patches on each subunit and quantified the affinities of these patches to DNA using their dissociation rate constants as a proxy. Then, we constructed the structural model of the whole cohesin complex and mapped the predicted high-affinity DNA binding patches on the structure. From the spatial relations of the predicted patches, we identified that multiple patches on the SMC1, SMC3, STAG1, and NIPBL subunits form a DNA clamping patch group. The simulations of the whole complex with double-stranded DNA molecules suggest that this patch group facilitates DNA bending and helps capture a DNA segment in the cohesin ring formed by the SMC1 and SMC3 subunits. In previous studies, these have been identified as critical steps in DNA loop extrusion. Therefore, this study provides experimentally testable predictions of DNA binding sites implicated in previously proposed DNA loop extrusion mechanisms and highlights the essential roles of the accessory subunits STAG1 and NIPBL in the mechanism.","published":"NA","server":"biorxiv"}]}
