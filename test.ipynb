      "Extracted abstract: The reconstitution of a cell nucleus in a lipid bilayer-enclosed synthetic cell makes great strides in bottom-up synthetic biology. In this study, we propose a method for assembling a nucleus in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). To induce reconstitution of the nucleus, we utilize interphase egg extract of African clawed frogsXenopus laevis, known as a biochemically controllable cell-free system capable of transforming an added sperm chromatin into a nucleusin vitro. We enhanced GUV formation efficiency by the inverted emulsion method through incorporating prolonged waiting time and adding chloroform into lipid-dispersed oil, facilitating subsequent nuclear assembly reactions in the GUVs.Characterization of nucleus-like structures formed in the GUVs revealed the presence of dense DNA and accumulated GFP-NLS in the structure, indicative of functional nuclear import. Immunostaining further validated the presence of nuclear pore complexes on the surfaces of these nucleus-like structures. Our approach offers a versatile platform for constructing artificial cellular systems that closely mimic eukaryotic cells.\n",

      "Extracted abstract: The impact of synonymous codon choice on protein output has important implications for understanding endogenous gene expression and design of synthetic mRNAs. Synonymous codons are decoded at different speeds, but simple models predict that this should not drive protein output. Instead, translation initiation should be the rate limiting step for production of protein per mRNA, with little impact of codon choice. Previously, we used a neural network model to design a series of synonymous fluorescent reporters and showed that their protein output in yeast spanned a seven-fold range corresponding to their predicted translation elongation speed. Here, we show that this effect is not due primarily to the established impact of slow elongation on mRNA stability, but rather, that slow elongation further decreases the number of proteins made per mRNA. We combine simulations and careful experiments on fluorescent reporters to show that translation is limited on non-optimally encoded transcripts. Using a genome-wide CRISPRi screen, we find that impairing translation initiation attenuates the impact of slow elongation, showing a dynamic balance between rate limiting steps of protein production. Our results show that codon choice can directly limit protein production across the full range of endogenous variability in codon usage.\n",
